# Once upon a time...

Scientists did _experiments_ using simple instruments.

They _wrote down_ what they did, and what they observed,
in their _lab notebook_.

They did this to keep a _record_ of everything they did, because it's
impossible to memorize all the details.

They also used their lab notebooks as evidence that they had actually
done the work they described in their papers.

# Science in the digital age

Traditional lab notebooks are still in use, and often the most convenient choice.

But more and more experiments are controlled by computers, and their results are collected by computers.

Data analysis is almost always done on computers.

Theoreticians run simulations, entirely in their computers.

We need to have the lab notebook in the computer!

# The electronic lab notebook

Tasks:

 - Create a log of all research activities
 - Keep track of changes to data and software
 - Data sharing among collaborators
 - [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science): doing research in public

---

# Your data from a computer's point of view

 - All data is stored in _files_.
 - Files are organized in _directories_ / _folders_.
 - A file contains a sequence of _bytes_, i.e. numbers in the range 0-255.
 - All data must be _encoded_ as a sequence of bytes.
 - There are many ways to do this: lots of _file formats_.

---

# The big divide: text vs. binary

## Text formats

 - First, encode your data as human-readable text.
 - Then, encode text as numbers.
 - There's general agreement about the second step: [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
 - But lots of way to encode data as text.


## Binary formats

 - Everything that's not on the left.
 - Includes Word, Open Office, RTF, ... which are not _just_ text.
 - Use problem-specific data encoding.
 - Often optimized for a specific purpose.

---

# Pros and cons

## Why use text formats?

 - **Lots** of software tools can handle text.
 - Straightforward inspection "by eye".
 - Relatively easy to write your own specialized tools.

## Why use binary formats?

 - Efficiency: smaller files, faster processing

---

# Open vs. proprietary formats

## Open formats

 - Documented: there is a written definition of the data encoding meant
   for human readers.
 - Used by different software packages

## Proprietary formats

 - Used by one or a few software packages
 - No documentation
 - Usually binary, to make reverse-engineering difficult

## Grey zone

 - Formats used by open-source software but not documented except in
   the source code: hard to use in practice.
 - Highly complex binary formats, theoretically documented but
   in practice unusable by anyone except the inventor (Microsoft Word, ...)

# File formats for the electronic lab notebook

**_Remember: data is at the core of science_**

## Avoid proprietary formats

 - Your software controls your data, not you.
 - One day the software will disappear - and your data along with it.
 - You can't share data with people who use different software.
 - You can't write your own software to handle your data.

## Prefer text formats

  - Lots of useful tools.
  - Easier to handle for everyone.

---

# Tools for text files

 - Usually created by software developers for software developers
 - Often powerful but not user-friendly
 - Most are designed to be used from a terminal

This style of working may look archaic and certainly requires
some learning effort. Trust me, it will pay off!
